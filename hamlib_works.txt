written in this files are the fixes and works that need to be done on the webapp

Scaling

1. same file identification and prevent dublicate uploads
(
    if user A has uploaded a.pdf and user B is also uploading a.pdf, then we need to stop another upload of the same file
    file record will be created for both the users but in the storage only one pdf file will be stored that is a.pdf instead
    of 2 a.pdf files.
)

2. Possible database switch ?
